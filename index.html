        <div>
          <p>
            This online checklist is created to help you plan and brave a major
            earthquake in your area. By taking the right measures, the effect of
            an earthquake can be reduced. Shifting off the ground is rarely the
            real reason for death or injury. Most deaths result from collapsing
            buildings, hurling projectiles, and falling debris. However, it is
            always important to develop your earthquake preparedness because
            earthquakes can occur with no sign. Gather up some emergency
            supplies and get ready to become earthquake prepared!

        <h1>Have on Hand For any Emergency</h1>
        <div>
          <p></p>
          <ol>
            <li class="list">
              Emergency Contact Information - Jot down three along with their
              respective addresses and an out-of-town relative or friend as a
              point-of-contact for separated family members.
            </li>

            <li class="list">
              Flashlight - Always have one at your disposal along with extra
              batteries. Flashlights are better to have on hand rather than
              candles, in order to prevent any unnecessary fires if an unknown
              gas leak occurs due to the earthquake.
            </li>

            <li class="list">
              Portable Radio - Similar to the Flashlight, a Portable Radio is
              good to have on hand because in the event of an earthquake, there
              will be outages and it will become your best source to find out
              what is going on and what to do next.
            </li>

            <li class="list">
              First Aid Kit - This and knowledge of first aid and CPR will come
              in handy if you or anyone around you has been injured or has gone
              into cardiac arrest. (include link of Red Cross courses)
            </li>

            <li class="list">
              Fire Extinguisher - In case of any small fires in or around your
              area, make sure you know how to use one and what types of fires
              they may put out. Your local fire department can train you!
            </li>

            <li class="list">
              Food and Water - Having non-perishable food and plenty of water on
              hand will come in handy in case of a power outage or any other
              circumstance. You should consider buying enough food that can last
              for at least 72 hours. Stock up on canned or dehydrated foods,
              dried fruits, canned juices, and powdered milk. To stock up on
              water, make sure you have three gallons per person for a 72-hour
              period. You can clean your water with purification tablets like
              Halazone and Globaline.
            </li>
            <li class="list">
              Medications and Special Diets - If you live with any pre-existing
              medical condition in which you need special medication, make sure
              to have a week’s worth of supply. For those families with infants,
              be prepared to stock up on special foods.
            </li>

            <li class="list">
              Tools - Check if you have wrenches to turn off any gas and water
              mains.

        <p>
          Educate your household how to turn off electricity, gas, and water
          main switches and valves. However, it is crucial to leave the gas on
          except there is an emergency.

        <p>
          Be aware of your surroundings, it is best to note potential hazards
          before the earthquake strikes in order to prevent. For example, if
          there are any hanging or sharp objects that can potentially fall and
          injure someone, relocate them to a safer place.
